I defended my Ph.D. thesis project entitled *"Combinatorics of analytic ideals"* in June 2022 at [Univerisidad de los Andes](https://uniandes.edu.co), under the supervision of [Carlos Augusto di Prisco de Venanzi](https://math.uniandes.edu.co/app/cv/site/institucional.php?Uid=ca.di&Cat=Planta&PW=). 

From September to December of 2022, I was in a research stay at [Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México](https://www.unam.mx/) in collaboration with [Michael Hrusak](https://www.matmor.unam.mx/~michael/) working on combinatorics of filters and ideals.

I attended the [Young Set Theory Workshop 2023](https://www.uni-muenster.de/MathematicsMuenster/events/2023/young_set_theory.shtml), held in Münster, Germany, from May 29th to June 3rd. During the workshop, I presented a poster entitled *Pathological lower semicontinuous sub-measures and* $F_\sigma$ *ideals on* $\omega$.

During the summer of 2023, I have been a research visit at [Technische Universität Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/) working in the project *Singular cardinals and cardinal characteristics* joint [Diana Carolina Montoya](https://dcmontoya.github.io/)
