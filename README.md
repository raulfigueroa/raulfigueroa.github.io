# Raúl Figueroa Sierra

I am a mathematician from Bogotá. I did my undergraduate studies at Universidad Nacional de Colombia. Next, I got my Master in Mathematics at Andes University in Bogotá under the direction of Professor [Xavier Caicedo](https://repositorio.uniandes.edu.co/handle/1992/44244). 

Currently, I am a PhD candidate and assistant teacher of Mathematics at Andes University in Bogotá, Colombia. I successfully defended my project entitled _Combinatorics of analytic ideals_ in June 2022 at [Univerisidad de los Andes](https://uniandes.edu.co), under the supervision of [Carlos Augusto di Prisco de Venanzi](https://math.uniandes.edu.co/app/cv/site/institucional.php?Uid=ca.di&Cat=Planta&PW=). My research interests focus on set theory. More precisely, I am interested in _forcing, infinite combinatorics, and characteristic cardinals_. 

From September to December of 2022, I was on a research stay at [Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México](https://www.unam.mx/) in collaboration with [Michael Hrusak](https://www.matmor.unam.mx/~michael/), where we worked on combinatorics of filters and ideals.

I attended the [Young Set Theory Workshop 2023](https://www.uni-muenster.de/MathematicsMuenster/events/2023/young_set_theory.shtml), held in Münster, Germany, from May 29th to June 3rd. During the workshop, I presented a poster entitled *Pathological lower semicontinuous sub-measures and* $F_\sigma$ *ideals on* $\omega$.

In the summer of 2023, I did a research visit at [Technische Universität Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/), where I was engaged in the project *Singular Cardinals and Cardinal Characteristics* joint with [Diana Carolina Montoya](https://dcmontoya.github.io/). During the visit, I also attended the [Sixth workshop on generalized Baire spaces](https://sites.google.com/view/gbs23/startseite) on July 26-28 at the Technische Universität Wien.
